step 1: We read the data
	feature engineering
step 2: you perform all the EDA your data should be ready for the training all the columns should be numerical

step 3: Feature selection
	select the import features
	1) p-value (regression)
	2) VIF     (regression)
	3) Highest correlation with target (regression and classification)
	4) Variance Threshold	(classification) 
	5) Mututal infor classify (classification)
		select k best
    6) Forward and Backward Selection (we generally dont use it)

step 4: Divide X and y
step 5: X_train, y_train,x_test, y_test = train_test_split()
   
step 6: Model Development

step 7: Predictions
	LR.predict(X_test)
	LR.predict([10])

step 8: Evaluation 
	MSE, RMSE, R2

step 9: coefficienct

=======Model performance you might not happy even though we select the features

we again build the model by apply the standardization (Other Models)
we again build the model b apply the normalization (LR/DL)
we again build the model by apply the PCA
    PCA: I do not want to drop the feature, i want to use all the feature

Data is modifying 
but here we will build only Linear regression only

Linear Regression : MSE, RMSE, R2-Score
classification : Accuercy score, Cf, pr, rc, f1,
