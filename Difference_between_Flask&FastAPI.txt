In FastAPI:

Use FastAPI instead of Flask.
Decorate endpoints using @app.get, @app.post, etc insted of @app.route in Flask
Use async def for defining route functions insted def use in Flask, as FastAPI is asynchronous by default.
For query parameters, you can use Query directly within the function parameters, providing type hints.
Return responses as dictionaries or model instances, FastAPI will automatically convert them to JSON.
Make sure you have FastAPI installed (pip install "fastapi[all]"). 
You can run the FastAPI app using Uvicorn: 'uvicorn app:app(Application_Name) --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000'
This command assumes your script is saved as app.py. Adjust the filename accordingly if it's different.
